ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification
This project uses machine learning to classify Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on sepal and petal measurements. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation using Scikit-Learn.

ðŸš€ Tech: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Build a model to predict Iris species accurately.
